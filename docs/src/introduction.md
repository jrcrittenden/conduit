# Introduction

Conduit is a multi-agent terminal user interface (TUI) that lets you run AI coding assistants side-by-side. Orchestrate Claude Code and Codex CLI in a tabbed interface with full session management, git integration, and real-time token tracking.

## Key Features

- **Session Persistence** — All conversations are saved and can be resumed later
- **Git Integration** — Automatic worktree management, branch status, and PR tracking
- **Build & Plan Modes** — Toggle between full execution and read-only analysis

- **Token Tracking** — Real-time usage and cost estimation in the status bar

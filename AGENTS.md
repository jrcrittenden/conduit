# AGENTS.md

Project-specific instructions for agents working in this repo.

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use Angular-style commit messages (e.g., `feat: ...`, `chore: ...`) and include a short detail summary in the body.

## Changes routine

- Based on complexity and affected surface, decide whether to follow the TDD red-green approach or not.
- Always run `cargo check --all` after making changes and before the last test cycle.

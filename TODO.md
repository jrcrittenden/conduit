## Done

- [x] When we have no workspaces under a project, it shows collapsed. It has to be shown expanded.
- [x] Dialogs are not showing when there's no workspace open. I tried Alt+I to import a session. Then when you open a tab the dialog is visible. Can you help me by compiling a list of all the keys that open dialogs so we can check which ones should be valid in this initial state?
